# Recursive Function to Reverse Sequence

This Go program defines a recursive function that takes an integer, divides it by 2 recursively, and prints the sequence in reverse order.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the program: `go run q2_main.go`
3. The function will print the reversed sequence of numbers generated from the input.

## Example

For input `9`, the output will be:

2
