# Word Sorting by 'a' Count and Length

This Go program sorts a list of words based on:
1. The number of occurrences of the letter "a" in each word (in decreasing order).
2. If the "a" count is the same, it sorts the words by length (in decreasing order).

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the program: `go run q1_main.go`
3. Enter words to add to the list or type `exit` to quit.

## Additional Features

- Users can add new words to the list during runtime.
- The program exits when the user types `exit`.
